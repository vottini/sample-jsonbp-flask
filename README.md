# Using json with Flask

This sample shows a possible way to use [jsonbp](https://github.com/vottini/jsonbp)
inside a Flask application. It consists of accepting a JSON with two decimal numbers
and offers the four basic arithmetic (+, -, ร, รท) operations as service endpoints.

The JSON blueprint is thus:

```
object Parameters {
  operand1: Decimal,
  operand2: Decimal
}
```
which in this sample project is saved as the file _"blueprints.jbp"_.
In the end, we'll come to develop a mean of using jsonbp in the following way:

```py
@app.route("/divide", methods=["POST"])
@deserialize_json("Parameters")
def division(payload):
  response = payload.operand1 / payload.operand2
  return str(response)
```

## Installation

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .environment
(.environment) $ source .environment/bin/activate
(.environment) $ pip3 install Flask jsonbp
```

## Running

### Server

In the same terminal where you sourced the activate script of venv,
run the server by issuing:

```bash
(.environment) $ python3 main.py
```

### Requester

This sample comes with a simple shell script _request.sh_ that
calls curl with the right parameters. Open a new terminal, navigate
to the sample directory, and issue requests to the server by running
this script:

```bash
$ ./request.sh
Usage: ./request.sh <operation> <number> <number>
Where <operation> can be:
- plus
- minus
- times
- divide

$. /request.sh plus 2 2
4.00
```

## Souce analysis

This sample is explained in 4 steps, where we'll incrementaly improve the
ease of use of jsonbp along Flask.

### Step #1 - Straight Method

Initially, let us just see how one can use jsonbp in a Flask annotated function
without giving much thought in how to make it less monolithic.

First of all, we must load the blueprint that declares the operands. Then,
during the response processing, we need to get the raw string sent to Flask
inside the POST request. We feed this string directly to jsonbp's blueprint
instance, which will return either if deserialization was successful or not.
If not, we prepare and return a response with status code 400 (bad request)
whose content is a string informing what was the problem. When the payload
is ok, we simply do the respective operation (add the numbers in this case)
and return the result.

```py
blueprints = jsonbp.load_file('blueprints.jbp')
deserializer = blueprints.choose_root('Parameters')

@app.route("/plus", methods=["POST"])
def addition():
  encoding = request.content_encoding or 'utf-8'
  payload = request.data.decode(encoding)
  success, outcome = deserializer.deserialize(payload)

  if not success:
    result = jsonify(str(msg))
    result.status_code = 400
    return result

  additionResponse = outcome['operand1'] + outcome['operand2']
  return str(additionResponse)

```

### Step #2 - Using Decorators

Now this same flow can be applied to most requests. For starters,
we can create a function that retrieves the string from the current
request and a function that creates bad responses. Then, in the same
veins as Flask, we can define a decorator to wrap the checking if the
payload is valid or not, and to automatically dispatch bad responses
whenever deserialization fails, like this:

```py
def get_request_payload():
  encoding = request.content_encoding or 'utf-8'
  return request.data.decode(encoding)

def make_error(msg):
  result = jsonify(str(msg))
  result.status_code = 400
  return result

def feed_json(function):
  def wrap():
    payload = get_request_payload()
    success, outcome = deserializer.deserialize(payload)

    if not success:
      return make_error(outcome)

    return function(outcome)

  return wrap

```

Then we can simply decorate the real core functionality, which must
be a function that receives at least one parameter (the deserialized
payload) and returns the appropriate response. This function doesn't
then need to have any verification code boilerplate, it can simply
trust that the payload obeys the blueprint definition. Note that our
decorator must come **after** the Flask route decorator:

```py
@app.route("/minus", methods=["POST"])
@feed_json
def subtraction(payload):
  response = payload['operand1'] - payload['operand2']
  return str(response)

```

### Step #3 - Parameterize the decorator

We can go a step further and parameterize the decorator itself to
accept a type to be the blueprint root. Moreover, we use _functools.wraps()_
to restore the wrapped function metadata, and make our _wrap()_
function well behaved by accepting any kind of parameters and passing
it along to the wrapped function, such that arguments besides our
payload can be received.

```py
import functools

def parse_json(root_type):
  blueprints = jsonbp.load_file("blueprints.jbp")
  deserializer = blueprints.choose_root(root_type)

  def deserializationDecorator(function):
    @functools.wraps(function)
    def wrap(*args, **kargs):
      payload = get_request_payload()
      success, outcome = deserializer.deserialize(payload)

      if not success:
        return make_error(outcome)

      return function(outcome, *args, **kargs)

    return wrap

  return deserializationDecorator
```

By doing this, we can now easily add verification to Flask decorated
functions by specifying the json schema that requests sent to them
must comply to.

```py
@app.route("/times", methods=["POST"])
@parse_json("Parameters")
def multiplication(payload):
  response = payload['operand1'] * payload['operand2']
  return str(response)

```

### Step #4 - Convenience

Finally, instead of returning a dict we can do an optional step
and turn it into a pure Python object, for easier access throughout our code. For
this we'll be using the [umapper](https://github.com/vottini/umapper) library:

```bash
(.environment) $ pip3 install umapper
```

```py
import umapper

def deserialize_json(root_type):
  blueprints = jsonbp.load_file("blueprints.jbp")
  deserializer = blueprints.choose_root(root_type)

  def deserializationDecorator(function):
    @functools.wraps(function)
    def wrap(*args, **kargs):
      payload = get_request_payload()
      success, outcome = deserializer.deserialize(payload)

      if not success:
        return make_error(outcome)

      return function(
        umapper.convert_to_object(outcome),
        *args, **kargs)

    return wrap

  return deserializationDecorator

```

And thus, inside our processing function, we can refer to
the fields present in the blueprint simply as the fields inside
an ordinary python object.

```py

@app.route("/divide", methods=["POST"])
@deserialize_json("Parameters")
def division(payload):
  response = payload.operand1 / payload.operand2
  return str(response)

```
